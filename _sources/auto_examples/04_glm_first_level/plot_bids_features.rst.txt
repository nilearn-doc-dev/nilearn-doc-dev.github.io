First level analysis of a complete BIDS dataset from openneuro
===============================================================


Full step-by-step example of fitting a GLM to perform a first level analysis
in an openneuro :term:`BIDS` dataset. We demonstrate how :term:`BIDS`
derivatives can be exploited to perform a simple one subject analysis with
minimal code. Details about the :term:`BIDS` standard are available at
`http://bids.neuroimaging.io/ <http://bids.neuroimaging.io/>`_.
We also demonstrate how to download individual groups of files from the
Openneuro s3 bucket.

More specifically:

1. Download an :term:`fMRI` :term:`BIDS` dataset with derivatives from openneuro.
2. Extract first level model objects automatically from the :term:`BIDS` dataset.
3. Demonstrate Quality assurance of Nistats estimation against available FSL.
   estimation in the openneuro dataset.
4. Display contrast plot and uncorrected first level statistics table report.

Fetch openneuro BIDS dataset
-----------------------------
We download one subject from the stopsignal task in the ds000030 V4 :term:`BIDS`
dataset available in openneuro.
This dataset contains the necessary information to run a statistical analysis
using Nilearn. The dataset also contains statistical results from a previous
FSL analysis that we can employ for comparison with the Nilearn estimation.

Obtain FirstLevelModel objects automatically and fit arguments
---------------------------------------------------------------
From the dataset directory we automatically obtain FirstLevelModel objects
with their subject_id filled from the :term:`BIDS` dataset. Moreover we obtain,
for each model, the list of run images and their respective events and
confound regressors. Those are inferred from the confounds.tsv files
available in the :term:`BIDS` dataset.
To get the first level models we have to specify the dataset directory,
the task_label and the space_label as specified in the file names.
We also have to provide the folder with the desired derivatives, that in this
case were produced by the :term:`fMRIPrep` :term:`BIDS` app.
